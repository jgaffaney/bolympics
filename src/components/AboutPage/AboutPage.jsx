        <p>The Beer Olympics are in their 4th year and growing every year.  
          This year, we are moving registration, brackets, scores, and results online!!
          
          Many details are still be worked out but this is where you will register your team and add teammates. 
          There will also be a spot for free agents that people will be able to contact and add to their teams.

          Much more to come!
